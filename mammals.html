          <p class="lead">“There are about forty-eight species of ocean dolphins and five species of river dolphins. They are found in all oceans of the world where they can be found predominantly in the shallower seas of the continental shelves. Very social animals, they tend to live in pods of up to a dozen members. However, in some areas where there is an abundance of foods, superpods can form with more than 1,000 dolphins. ” <a href="http://marinebio.org/oceans/dolphins/">Marinebio, “Dolphins”</a>

          <p class="lead">“Their scientific name is Megaptera noveangliae. This means "giant wings", which refers to their large front flippers that can reach a length of 4.6m (or, around 15ft)—about one-third of the animal's entire body length.”
            <br>
            <br>
            Despite their enormous size humpback whales are extremely agile, 
            “One of the humpback's more spectacular behaviors is thebreach. Breaching is a true leap where a whale generates enough upward force with its powerful flukes to lift approximately 2/3 of its body out of the water. A breach may also involve a twisting motion, when the whale twists its body sideways as it reaches the height of the breach.” <a href="http://marinebio.org/species.asp?id=39">Marinebio, “Humpback Whales”</a></p>

          <p class="lead">"The manatee has been linked to folklore on mermaids. Native Americans ground the bones to treat asthma and earache. In West African folklore, they were considered sacred and thought to have been once human. Killing one was taboo and required penance."<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manatee"> Wikipedia, "Manatee"</a>

            Unfortunately, while the manatee’s interaction with man has been mythical it has also led to peril for the lovable “sea cow”
            <br>
            <br>
            "The main causes of death for manatees are human-related issues, such as habitat destruction and human objects…Their slow-moving, curious nature, coupled with dense coastal development, has led to many violent collisions with propeller-driven boats and ships, leading frequently to maiming, disfigurement, and even death." <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manatee">Wikipedia, "Manatee"</a>

          <p class="lead">"Although most polar bears are born on land, they spend most of their time on the sea ice. Their scientific name means "maritime-bear", and derives from this fact. Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of sea ice, often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present. Because of their dependence on the sea ice, polar bears are classified as marine mammals."<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_bear"> Wikipedia, "Polar Bear"</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            Unfortunately, the polar bear’s dependence on ocean life has led to it being threatened by a loss of habitat.
            <br>
            <br>
            "Because of expected habitat loss caused by climate change, the polar bear is classified as a vulnerable species, and at least three of the nineteen polar bear subpopulations are currently in decline. For decades, large-scale hunting raised international concern for the future of the species, but populations rebounded after controls and quotas began to take effect." <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_bear">Wikipedia, "Polar bear"</a>
